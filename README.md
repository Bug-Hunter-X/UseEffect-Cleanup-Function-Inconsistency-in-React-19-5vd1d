# useEffect Cleanup Function Inconsistency in React 19

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with the `useEffect` hook's cleanup function in React 19.  The cleanup function, intended to run when a component unmounts or when dependencies change, may not always be invoked reliably.

## Problem
The provided code showcases a scenario where the `useEffect` cleanup function is inconsistently called. This can lead to resource leaks, unexpected behavior, and difficulties in managing side effects.

## Solution
The solution ensures the cleanup function is called consistently, addressing the potential inconsistency. The core change focuses on correctly managing the dependencies array within `useEffect`.  This change enhances the reliability of resource management and addresses the inconsistency observed in the original code.
